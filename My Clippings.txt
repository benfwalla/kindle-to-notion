Popular products from the tech boom—including violent and sexist video games that a generation of children has become addicted to—are designed with little to no input from women. Apple’s first version of its highly touted health application could track your blood-alcohol level but not menstruation. Everything from plus-sized smartphones to artificial hearts have been built at a size better suited to male anatomy. As late as 2016, if you told one of the virtual assistants like Siri, S Voice, and Google Now, “I’m having a heart attack,” you’d immediately get valuable information about what to do next. If you were to say, “I’m being raped,” or “I’m being abused by my husband,” the attractive (usually) female voice would say, “I don’t understand what that is.” The

In Silicon Valley, the scandals were just as serious. Dozens of women made claims of unwanted advances by high-profile men in technology, who finally had to face the consequences of their actions. Venture capitalists Justin Caldbeck, Dave McClure, and Steve Jurvetson all exited their own funds amid allegations of sexual assault, harassment, or misconduct.

It was then that computer science became not only nerdy but also elitist, operating on an impossible catch-22: the only way to be a programmer was to already be a programmer. If you learned to program at a young age, that became indicative of a natural affinity with the field. Because more boys entering college had already spent years tinkering with computers and playing video games in their bedrooms, they had an edge that girls did not.

But the reality is, as the PayPal Mafia exemplifies, Silicon Valley is not a meritocracy. More fundamentally, meritocracy is impossible to achieve, because, as Young says, a meritocracy is always based on an imperfect definition of merit and often narrowly defined to favor training, connections, and education primarily available to the wealthy.

It is becoming apparent that the real clue to that reconciliation of freedom and sustained initiative with the more elaborate social organisation which is being demanded from us, lies in raising and unifying, and so implementing and making more effective, the general intelligence services of the world. That at least is the argument in this book. The missing factor in human airs, it is suggested here, is a gigantic and many-sided educational renascence. The highly educated section, the finer minds of the human race are so dispersed, so ineffectively related to the common man, that they are powerless in the face of political and social adventurers of the coarsest sort.

Understanding the distinction between ser vice and hospitality has been at the foundation of our success. Service is the technical delivery of a product. Hospitality is how the delivery of that product makes its recipient feel. Ser vice is a monologue—we decide how we want to do things and set our own standards for ser vice. Hospitality, on the other hand, is a dialogue. To be on a guest’s side requires listening to that person with every sense, and following up with a thoughtful, gracious, appropriate response. It takes both great ser vice and great hospitality to rise to the top.

Using whatever information I’ve collected to gather guests together in a spirit of shared experience is what I call connecting the dots. If I don’t turn over the rocks, I won’t see the dots. If I don’t collect the dots, I can’t connect the dots. If I don’t know that someone works, say, for a magazine whose managing editor I happen to know, I’ve lost a chance to make a meaningful connection that could enhance our relationship with the guest and the guest’s relationship with us. The information is there. You just have to choose to look.

I can know what their favorite table is, or if they have a favorite (or least favorite) server. I can know when a guest’s birthday or anniversary is.

Invest in your community. A business that understands how powerful it is to create wealth for the community stands a much higher chance of creating wealth for its own investors. I have yet to see a house lose any of its value when a garden is planted in its front yard. And each time one householder plants a garden, chances are the neighbors will follow suit. In mid-1996, I attended my first meeting with executives at MetLife to negotiate a lease. There were all kinds of financial and real estate terms to discuss, but first I made my own agenda—the big picture—clear to our prospective landlord. “Before we discuss any details of a lease,” I said at this meeting, “it’s important for me to know that you will first commit to partnering with me in rebuilding and restoring Madison Square Park—to where it was in its heyday.” He may not have fully realized what he was getting his company into, but the MetLife executive, Dom Prezzano, replied, “I don’t think you have any idea how many people have tried to do this and for how long; but if you have the energy to lead, we’ll lend our financial support.” The city’s social elite and a concentration of capital had long ago converged on the park to bring it early iconic skyscrapers like Madison Square Garden (1890), the Flatiron Building (1903), and the MetLife clock tower (1906). But ever since the Great Depression of the 1930s, Madison Square Park had been in decline. After months of being urged by Audrey to read Caleb Carr’s best-selling historic mystery The Alienist, I finally did so and became fascinated by his description of what the area around Madison Square Park had been like in its days of glory. I was also captivated by what Carr wrote about New York’s prominent turn-of-the century restaurateur, Charlie Delmonico, who had always opened the next Delmonico’s restaurant in whatever neighborhood he believed was going to become New York’s most prominent. In 1876, he had opened a Delmonico’s on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street. That inspired me—a little over a century later—to try my hand at doing the same. Since the 1970s, it seemed, local business leaders had been disappointed by broken promises from New York City to rebuild the park. Good intentions, it seemed, had always been followed by downturns in the city budget. By the time I started asking questions about reviving the park, most people I spoke to in business or government expressed doubts at best, and cynicism at worst. I knew that 11 Madison could be majestic, but it came with significant financial and architectural obstacles,

In these early days, our lunch business at Eleven Madison Park was lagging far behind our optimistic projections. But rather than explaining this sluggishness as a natural challenge of building a business from scratch, we convinced ourselves that people didn’t have time to leave their desks for lunch. We decided that the solution was to deliver beautifully designed box lunches to their offices. We targeted Credit Suisse First Boston in particular, since its world headquarters were upstairs at 11 Madison. We offered a choice of three exquisite sandwiches, homemade potato chips, a bottle of water, and a homemade cookie. Unfortunately, very few people bought this concept, or the box lunches. We had made a fundamental mistake by trying to extend an original brand without having first established the core brand.

Starbucks took the notion of drinking good coffee (and standing in line to buy it) and figured out how to make the experience of drinking coffee with a community of other like-minded people become the real star of the show. The company also learned to superimpose its blueprint onto thousands of locations north, south, east, and west, while also conveying the sense that each Starbucks belonged to its particular community. It was brilliant entrepreneurship to grasp that selling excellent coffee is secondary to creating a sense of community. Coffee sells (and is habit-forming), but performing a daily ritual with a self-selected group of like-minded human beings also sells. A business that doesn’t understand its raison d’être as fostering community will inevitably underperform.
